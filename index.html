            <p class="second-paragraph">My name is Susy Bando. You can Call Me a Food Lover but please do not call me a foodie.
                Your definition of foodie may be different than mine but in my mind, a foodie is pretentious about
                their food experiences and spends more time picking apart the pieces of a meal/dish rather than enjoying
                the moment. I think of myself as a person who loves to eat (and drink) delicious things.</p>
